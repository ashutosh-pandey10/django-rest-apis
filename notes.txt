Q. In DRF the type of Response(data) is not json, then how do I get a json response 
at my front end? What is happening in between?

In Django Rest Framework (DRF), when you create an API view and return a Response 
object with some data, the data itself is not directly returned as JSON. Instead, 
DRF performs some steps behind the scenes to convert the data into JSON format 
before sending it to the frontend.

Let's break down the process of what happens in between:

    Data Serialization: 
    When you return data from your API view using a Response 
    object, DRF internally uses serializers to convert complex data types (like 
    Django model instances) into a format that can be easily converted to JSON. 
    Serialization is the process of converting complex data types into a format 
    that can be stored, transmitted, or displayed. DRF provides powerful 
    serialization tools that allow you to define how your data should be 
    converted.

    Content Negotiation: 
    DRF employs content negotiation to determine the format in which the response 
    should be returned. Content negotiation is the process of selecting the best 
    representation of a resource based on the client's preferences, as indicated 
    by the request's headers. Typically, when you make an API request, your 
    request's Accept header specifies the desired response format (e.g., JSON, 
    XML, etc.).

    JSON Rendering: 
    Once the data is serialized, and content negotiation determines that JSON is 
    the desired format, DRF uses its JSON renderer to convert the serialized data
    into a JSON response. The JSON renderer takes care of serializing the data 
    into JSON format and setting the appropriate response headers to indicate that
    the response content is in JSON format.

    HTTP Response: 
    Finally, the JSON-rendered data is included in the HTTP response object that 
    gets sent back to the frontend. The frontend, whether it's a web browser, a 
    mobile app, or any other client, receives this response and can parse the 
    JSON content to work with the data.

So, even though you might not explicitly see the JSON conversion code in your DRF
view, DRF's serialization, content negotiation, and rendering processes work 
together to ensure that the response data is converted to JSON format before 
reaching the frontend. This abstraction allows you to focus on defining your API 
endpoints and business logic without worrying about the specifics of data 
conversion and response formatting.
